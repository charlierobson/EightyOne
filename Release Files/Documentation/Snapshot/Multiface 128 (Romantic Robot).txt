Multiface 128 for the ZX Spectrum
Romantic Robot
=================================

INTRODUCTION.

MULTIFACE 128 is a true MULTIpurpose interFACE with:

   1) Fully universal and 100% automatic BACK-UP facility for tape, microdrive, Discovery,
   Plus D or Disciple
   2) 8K RAM extension - suitable for our GENIE, LIFEGUARD, or as a buffer, etc.
   3) MULTI TOOLKIT to study/modify/develop programs, POKE infinite lives, etc.


CONNECTING THE MULTIFACE.

The Spectrum must be switched OFF before attaching/removing the Multiface 128.

MULTIFACE 128 plugs:
   a) on the SPECTRUM edge connector - for tape users
   b) on the INTERFACE 1 edge connector - if used with microdrives
   c) between the SPECTRUM and Plus D, DISCIPLE or DISCOVERY

Check all connections carefully before switching the Spectrum ON, or else serious damage may
occur and your guarantee will be VOID. A proper attachment is vital for the functioning of the
Multiface - and a bad contact is the cause of 99% of all problems. If attaching/using the M128
brings random coloured squares or other garbage on the screen, clean the edge connector with an
ink eraser and re-connect the Multiface 128. If your system and the Multiface still should not
work, switch the Spectrum OFF, remove any add-ons except the Multiface, re-read these
instructions carefully and try again. Should you really not succeed, please telephone us on
01-200 8870 or write to us. Please do NOT return the Multiface until we ask you to do so. In
such case, please use the original packaging, state your name, address, phone and describe the
problem and the whole equipment used. Please read the guarantee conditions carefully as well.


Notes On Spectrum Crashes:

Very rarely, a Spectrum may have a substandard Z80 and be unfit for the Multiface. The typical
effects are:
a) the first pressing of the Multiface's red button causes the Spectrum to reset/crash (as NEW or
reset)
b) further pressing of the red button has no effect whatsoever.

Your Spectrum may otherwise seem to be working perfectly, since only a few hardware devices,
such as the Multiface, use one particular "line" (NMI), which you may have never needed before.
The use of NMI is essential for the Multiface and if your Spectrum (or more precisely its Z80) is
faulty, you can either have it replaced or repaired. We can carry out the repair ourselves at the
cost of £14.95 - we will need your Spectrum (without the power supply), Multiface and a
payment by cheque, PO, cash or card. If you prefer to have your Spectrum checked and/or
repaired locally, please do ensure that the repair shop gets the Multiface as well, so that your
whole set-up will be made to work properly. It is also good idea to try the Multiface on another
Spectrum to help to establish that it is really YOUR Spectrum that is faulty.


USING THE MULTIFACE.

Multiface 128 works on the Spectrum 48/128/ + 2. It can be used any time in any mode: It is
immaterial what is inside the Spectrum at that moment or how or from what source (tape, disk,
cartridge) it has been loaded (or typed in, etc.). Multiface does not save programs, but computer
contents (compressed RAM image). Upon returning from the M128 or upon re-loading, the
programs continue as if never frozen. To use the M128:
       1) Push the red button to activate the Multiface and obtain the MAIN MENU
       2) Select the required option from the menu by pressing its relevant key - it is always
          shown in inverse and it is usually the first letter, such as e for exit).

The MAIN MENU options are:

exit - to abandon the Multiface and exit to BASIC (provided BASIC is present)
       By using exit, you come out of the Multiface entirely. All efforts are made to preserve the
       current program in the Spectrum intact. The main condition is the existence of standard
       system variables - without these the Spectrum crashes. A successful exit gives you full
       access to the program (you may miss the MULTI TOOLKIT, though). To restart it, if
       needed, you must know the starting line or address. Exit is impossible in the 128K mode
       when the edit ROM is paged and Spectrum ROM is OFF; in such case it does not appear on
       the menu at all. All in all, you can only exit to BASIC if it exists - it is like jumping into a
       pool: a joy if it's full of water, a crash if there is none.

return - to continue the program

save - to proceed to the SAVE routines:
       a) input the name of the program
       up to 9 characters (or just press ENTER to input RUN automatically as a default)
       b) save to: tape  microdrive  opus  disciple (use d for Plus D interface, too)
       You can save the entire program (including the screen) or the screen only. Programs are
       compressed to take the minimal room possible and to load faster. Screens saved on their
       own are left intact as standard Spectrum hi-res screens
       c) format microdrive cartridges more effectively, ideally to 100 + K.
       Cartridges are automatically named after the programs to be saved.
       
tool - to access the MULTI TOOLKIT routines
       quit - to return to the main menu
       ENTER - to PEEK and scroll through addresses or to POKE
       SPACE - to allow you to type in a new address
       hex - to toggle between hexadecimal and decimal display format
       reg - to point to the Z80 registers as they were when the program was frozen.
          They start from the program counter (PC-low, hi) and can also be changed.
       window - to open a window with full on-screen editing using the cursor keys.
          The flashing window address corresponds to the address in the bottom edit line.
          The window display is by default in hex, but you can change it to
       text - to see the 128 bytes in the window as ASCII text.
       select - to inspect RAM banks 0-7 on 128K Spectrums. Press s + the bank number
print - to dump screen to printer.
       For printer interfaces using COPY command - Multiprint, ZX Lprint II, Kempston.
       You can POKE address 8200 with the following values, if you wish to:
       113 to turn the line feed ON (CR plus LF, i. e. sending 13 plus 10)
       112 to turn the line feed OFF (CR only)
       17 to dump screen as text (text copy) with the line feed on (CR + LF)
       16 to dump screen as text (text copy) with the line feed off (CR only).
       These pokes can be used on the above Interfaces in EPSON default.
          
jump - not to return, but jump to another address. Strictly for machine code users only!
       Enter the address to jump at 8192/3 (low/hi). You can jump to Spectrum ROM/RAM AND
       to M128 8K RAM. As the M128 RAM overshadows the ZX ROM (8192-16383), address
       8194 determines the paging status: if it is 0, the M128 RAM remains paged, 1 pages out the
       RAM and any other value disables the jump command entirely.

       You can jump from the main menu, and you can also pre-program Multiface to jump
       directly upon pressing the red button and by-pass M128 operating system entirely. To
       program the "direct jump", POKE 8192-3 with the jump address as usual, and then also
       8195-7 with a special identification code word RUN (i. e. 82, 85, 87). Whenever you push
       the button now, you will jump to the predefined address and not even see the M128 menu.
       To return from your program to the program you stopped, use RST 0. To revert back to the
       Multiface normal operation, press the red button and BREAK key simultaneously - this also
       cancels the code word RUN.

       In standard mode Multiface uses 8192-11144 as a buffer (8192-13496 once you proceed to
       SAVE) and overwrites anything in there. Using direct jump, you have 8257-16338 available
       - plus all of Spectrum RAM to which you can also jump to.

clear - to clear the extra 64K RAM bank (in 128K mode only!)
       You can clear any time, but it is only useful with 48K programs in 128K mode. However,
       you should save 48K programs in 48K mode anyway. Also, for obvious reasons, clearing
       the banks in 128K programs is not a good idea...

                                 PIRACY IS ILLEGAL!
                   MULTIFACE 128 is NOT designed to encourage piracy!

GENERAL HINTS and TIPS.

Using The On/Off Switch.

Multiface 128 has a software switch to make it (in)visible, mainly to prevent possible clashes
with other hardware/software.

As a rule, M128 can ALWAYS be activated, irrespective if previously set ON or OFF. Upon
powering up the Spectrum, the Multiface 128 is automatically OFF! - thus loading a program
SAVED previously by the Multiface 128 will leave a partially corrupted screen. To switch the
M128 ON, press the red button, which both activates AND switches it ON. Press r to return and
the M128 will remain ON. You can switch it OFF by pressing o when you are in the M128 main
menu - o simply toggles between ON/OFF as shown.


Using The Extra 8K RAM.

Multiface has an 8K ROM (containing its own software) and an 8K RAM used as a buffer. You
can use the 8K RAM for your own m/code routines or for data, but NOT for BASIC. The RAM
must be paged in machine code to be accessed: use IN A,(191) to page IN and IN A,(63) to
page OUT. The IN and OUT BASIC commands can not be used here. The 8K RAM overshadows
the Spectrum ROM and thus anything contained in the M128 RAM cannot make any calls to the
Spectrum ROM, as they both occupy the same area. M128 RAM routines should therefore be self
contained, independent of Spectrum ROM. All in all, the use of the M128 RAM requires a good
knowledge of m/c - or else forget it...


Poking Infinite Lives.

To start with, please ensure that you are not infringing copyright. To POKE, say, 31000,0: First
load a program as usual. When it's loaded, push the Multiface button and select the tool by
pressing t. When the toolkit menu appears, press SPACE and type 31000. Once you type 5 digits
(address is always 5 digits long), the cursor automatically moves to the value field (no need to
press ENTER), so type 0 (value is 1-3 digits long) and this time press ENTER. Finally press q to
quit the toolkit and r to return to the program.
