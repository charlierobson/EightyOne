==============================
The Parrot for the ZX80 / ZX81
R.I.S.T. Inc.
==============================

The Parrot uses port $4F to write to and read the status back from the SP0256.
Only address lines A7, A5 and A4 are decoded, so it will respond to any port
address in the form of b0x00xxxx. This makes The Parrot incompatible with
devices such as ZXpand+.

When reading from the Sp0256, the 'busy' status is reported in bit 0. The bit
has a value of 0.
