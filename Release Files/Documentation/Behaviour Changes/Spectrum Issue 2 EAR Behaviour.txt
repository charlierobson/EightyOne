===========================================
Issue 2 Ear State Issue for the ZX Spectrum
===========================================

The state of the EAR line can be set by writing out to port $xxFE, with the
value held in bit 4 defining the state. A read back from port $xxFE returns
the state of the EAR line in bit 6, and on all issues of Spectrum apart from
the issue 2 the value returned matches the value previously written to the
EAR line. On the issue 2 Spectrum, the state written to the MIC line (bit 3) 
affects the actual value read back from the EAR line.

With no keys pressed, other issue Spectrums will always return 255 but for an
issue 2 Spectrum the value return may be 191 or 255. The actual value returned
depends on the time between writing to the port and reading it back - if the
time is below a certain threshold then a value of 255 is returned, if above
the threshold then a value of 191 is returned.

The following BASIC program demonstrates the difference between issues of
Spectrum:

  10 OUT 254,BIN 11101111
  20 PRINT IN 254
  30 OUT 254,BIN 11111111
  40 PRINT IN 254
  50 GO TO 10

An output toggling between 191 and 255 only occurs on non-issue 2 Spectrums.

The following program is required for an issue 2 Spectrum to also produce an
output that toggles between 191 and 255:
      
  10 OUT 254,BIN 11100111
  20 PRINT IN 254
  30 OUT 254,BIN 11111111
  40 PRINT IN 254
  50 GO TO 10

The keyboard is also read via port $xxFE (bits 0-4) and so for a program to
successfully work on all issues of Spectrum, the value returned from the port
should not be explicitly tested but either the state of individual key bits
checked or the upper 3 bits masked off before testing the returned value.
