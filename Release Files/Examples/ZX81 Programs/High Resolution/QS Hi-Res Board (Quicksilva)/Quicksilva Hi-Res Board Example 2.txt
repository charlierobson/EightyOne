"Histogramme" from "Etudes Pour ZX81 Tome 2"

============================================

You are asked to enter three pieces of information: the title of the histogram,
the maximum value for the vertical scale and the number of data values. When
entering the data values, make sure they do not exceed the maximum.

Once the histogram has been drawn, press key P to produce a copy to the ZX Printer,
or any other key to create a new histogram.
