=========================================================

The program allows you to draw nine characters at the same time and will calculate
the hexadecimal values that need to be used to define those characters via Quicksilva's
CHRS utility. Run the program and then enable the QS Character Board.

You draw the characters by moving the flashing cursor around using the keys 5, 6, 7 and
8.You toggle between drawing black and white pixels using key B. Once the characters
have been drawn, press key H and the hexadecimal values will be calculated. Press key C
to create a copy of the screen to the ZX Printer.
